# Make predictions
home_stats = {
    'LAST_GAME_OE': 0.65,
    'HOME_WIN_PCTG': 0.70,
    'NUM_REST_DAYS': 2.0,
    'AWAY_WIN_PCTG': 0.60,
    'TOTAL_WIN_PCTG': 0.65,
    'ROLLING_SCORING_MARGIN': 5.0,
    'ROLLING_OE': 0.68

away_stats = {
    'LAST_GAME_OE': 0.58,
    'HOME_WIN_PCTG': 0.65,
    'NUM_REST_DAYS': 1.0,
    'AWAY_WIN_PCTG': 0.55,
    'TOTAL_WIN_PCTG': 0.60,
    'ROLLING_SCORING_MARGIN': -2.0,
    'ROLLING_OE': 0.60
}

prediction, probability = model.predict_home_win(home_stats, away_stats)
print(f"Prediction: {'WIN' if prediction == 1 else 'LOSS'}")
print(f"Win Probability: {probability:.3f}")
```
